# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

A function definition is a block of code that can be invoked. Functions typically will take an input and produce an output. Functions are used for efficiency and organization, essentially, to keep programs DRY.

#### 2. What is a method?

A method is a function that is within an object. Essentially, it is the behavior of an object.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

.substring(), .toUpperCase(), .charAt(), .slice(), .split()

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

Accessor methods are non-destructive and mutator methods are destructive. This means that accessors return data without affecting the original data and mutators alter the original data.

You might use an accessor if you're just trying to retrieve data without altering it, while you may choose to use a mutator if you're trying to alter data.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

console.log() simply logs to the console your desired output. It does not actually produce an output that can be used by other parts of your program. Return actually returns a result that can be used and short circuits the rest of its code block.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Working through challenges is the most useful form of learning for me, personally.
